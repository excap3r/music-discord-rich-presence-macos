## ‚ú® Overview

Deezer RPC is a lightweight application that displays your currently playing Deezer music on Discord through Rich Presence integration. Let your friends see what you're listening to in real-time with artist information, track titles, and timestamps.

## üéµ Features

- **Real-time Music Display**: Shows your current Deezer tracks on Discord in real-time
- **Song Details**: Displays song title, artist name, and album
- **Time Tracking**: Shows elapsed time and duration of the current track
- **Automatic Detection**: Seamlessly detects when Deezer is active
- **Low Resource Usage**: Minimal impact on system performance
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS and Windows

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Deezer desktop application (installed and running)
- Discord desktop application (installed and running)
- Internet connection for Discord Rich Presence updates

## üöÄ Installation

### Easy Method

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deezer-rpc.git
   cd deezer-rpc
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Virtual Environment (Recommended)

For a cleaner installation, use a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üéÆ Usage

1. Ensure Discord is running and the "Display current activity as a status message" setting is enabled
2. Make sure Deezer is running and playing music
3. Launch Deezer RPC:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The application will run in the background and automatically update your Discord status with your current Deezer track information.

To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize Deezer RPC by editing the configuration in `deezer_rpc/utils/config.py`:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `UPDATE_INTERVAL` | How frequently to update Discord presence (in seconds) |
| `CLIENT_ID` | Discord application client ID |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging detail level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) |
| `SHOW_TIME_REMAINING` | Whether to display time remaining or elapsed |

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **Discord status not updating:**
  - Ensure both Discord and Deezer applications are running
  - Check that Discord's game activity setting is enabled in User Settings > Activity Status
  - Restart Discord if the Rich Presence doesn't appear after a few minutes

- **Application crashes:**
  - Check the log file `deezer_rpc.log` for detailed error messages
  - Make sure you've installed all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Ensure you're using Python 3.6 or higher

- **High CPU usage:**
  - Try increasing the update interval in the configuration file

## üîÑ Updating

To update to the latest version:

```bash
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
