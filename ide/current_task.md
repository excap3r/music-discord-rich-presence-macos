# Music RPC Project Update

## Project Overview
Music RPC is a Python application that integrates with Discord to display currently playing music from various music players (Deezer, Apple Music, iTunes, Tidal) on Discord using Rich Presence. The application detects active music players, extracts song information, and updates the Discord status accordingly.

## Code Structure
The project has the following structure:
- `music_rpc/` - Main package
  - `core/` - Core application logic
    - `app.py` - Main application class
    - `song_info.py` - Song information retrieval
    - `discord_presence.py` - Discord integration
    - `window_manager.py` - Window detection and management
    - `tray_icon.py` - System tray icon
  - `config/` - Configuration management
    - `settings.py` - Application settings
  - `logging/` - Logging system
    - `handlers.py` - Custom logging handlers
  - `main.py` - Entry point script
  - Various build scripts and resources

## Identified Issues
1. Inconsistent naming (deezer_rpc vs. music_rpc)
2. Duplicate files/assets in different locations
3. Multiple build scripts with overlapping functionality
4. Limited docstrings and type hints
5. Inadequate error handling in core components
6. Print statements instead of proper logging
7. Code duplication in several areas

## Improvement Checklist

### 1. Code Organization ✅
- [x] Rename package from "deezer_rpc" to "music_rpc"
- [x] Update imports to reflect new naming
- [x] Standardize naming conventions across codebase
- [x] Consolidate duplicate assets
- [x] Update documentation to reflect new naming

### 2. Code Quality ✅
- [x] Add docstrings to all core files
- [x] Add type hints to all function parameters and return values
- [x] Implement consistent error handling in core modules
- [x] Replace print statements with proper logging levels
- [x] Reduce code duplication

### 3. Architecture
- [ ] Create proper interfaces/abstractions for player detection
- [ ] Implement plugin system for new music players
- [ ] Improve configuration system with typing
- [ ] Separate UI logic from core functionality

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for core components
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the player detection
- [ ] Add test harnesses for Discord integration
- [ ] Setup CI/CD pipeline

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive README
- [ ] Add setup instructions
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Add developer documentation

### 6. Build/Deploy
- [ ] Consolidate build scripts
- [ ] Add proper dependency management
- [ ] Create installer package
- [ ] Setup auto-updates

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Code Organization ✅
Focus on standardizing the codebase naming and organization.
- [x] Rename package and update imports
- [x] Fix file structure and remove duplicates
- [x] Update documentation references

### Phase 2: Code Quality ✅
Enhance code quality through better typing, docstrings, and error handling.
- [x] Add docstrings to `music_rpc/core/app.py`
- [x] Add type hints to `music_rpc/core/app.py`
- [x] Add docstrings and type hints to `main.py`
- [x] Implement error handling in `music_rpc/core/app.py`
- [x] Improve logging system (`music_rpc/logging/handlers.py`)
- [x] Update configuration management (`music_rpc/config/settings.py`)
- [x] Enhance Discord Presence Manager (`music_rpc/core/discord_presence.py`) with proper typing and error handling
- [x] Update Window Manager (`music_rpc/core/window_manager.py`) with better abstractions and error handling
- [x] Enhance Tray Icon functionality (`music_rpc/core/tray_icon.py`) with proper error handling
- [x] Improve song info retrieval (`music_rpc/core/song_info.py`) with type hints and better error handling

## Current Progress
The project has been standardized to "Music RPC" and comprehensive code quality improvements have been implemented across all core files:

1. Completed:
   - Package renamed to "music_rpc"
   - Imports updated to reflect new naming
   - Duplicate assets consolidated
   - Documentation updated with new naming
   - Type hints and docstrings added to all key files
   - Error handling implemented in all core modules
   - Logging system enhanced with proper log rotation and type hints
   - Configuration module improved with better type hints and error handling
   - Discord Presence Manager updated with comprehensive type hints and error handling
   - Window Manager refactored with better abstractions and more robust error handling
   - Tray Icon functionality enhanced with proper error handling and type hints
   - Song Info Retriever improved with type hints, better error handling, and enhanced object structure
   - Fixed critical bug in app.py where start_tray_app() was called without the required app parameter

2. Next Steps:
   - Move on to Phase 3: Architecture improvements
   - Create proper interfaces/abstractions for player detection
   - Implement plugin system for new music players
   - Improve configuration system with typing
   - Separate UI logic from core functionality
