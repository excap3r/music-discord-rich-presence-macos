# Music RPC Project Update

## Project Overview
Music RPC is a Python application that integrates with Discord to display currently playing music from various music players (Deezer, Apple Music, iTunes, Tidal) on Discord using Rich Presence. The application detects active music players, extracts song information, and updates the Discord status accordingly.

## Code Structure
The project has the following structure:
- `music_rpc/` - Main package
  - `core/` - Core application logic
    - `app.py` - Main application class
    - `song_info.py` - Song information retrieval
    - `discord_presence.py` - Discord integration
    - `window_manager.py` - Window detection and management
    - `player_detection/` - Player detection abstractions and implementations
      - `base.py` - Base interfaces and registry
      - `deezer.py` - Deezer player implementation
      - `apple_music.py` - Apple Music player implementation
      - `registry.py` - Registry initialization
  - `ui/` - User interface components
    - `tray_icon.py` - System tray icon (moved from core)
  - `config/` - Configuration management
    - `settings.py` - Application settings
  - `logging/` - Logging system
    - `handlers.py` - Custom logging handlers
  - `main.py` - Entry point script
  - Various build scripts and resources

## Identified Issues
1. Inconsistent naming (deezer_rpc vs. music_rpc)
2. Duplicate files/assets in different locations
3. Multiple build scripts with overlapping functionality
4. Limited docstrings and type hints
5. Inadequate error handling in core components
6. Print statements instead of proper logging
7. Code duplication in several areas

## Improvement Checklist

### 1. Code Organization ✅
- [x] Rename package from "deezer_rpc" to "music_rpc"
- [x] Update imports to reflect new naming
- [x] Standardize naming conventions across codebase
- [x] Consolidate duplicate assets
- [x] Update documentation to reflect new naming

### 2. Code Quality ✅
- [x] Add docstrings to all core files
- [x] Add type hints to all function parameters and return values
- [x] Implement consistent error handling in core modules
- [x] Replace print statements with proper logging levels
- [x] Reduce code duplication

### 3. Architecture ✅
- [x] Create proper interfaces/abstractions for player detection
- [x] Separate UI logic from core functionality

### 4. Documentation ✅
- [x] Create comprehensive README
- [x] Add setup instructions (consolidated in README.md)
- [x] Document configuration options (consolidated in README.md)
- [x] Create user guide (consolidated in README.md)
- [x] Add developer documentation (consolidated in README.md)
- [x] Consolidate all documentation into a single, well-organized README.md

## Future Improvements
1. Add support for more music players (Spotify, VLC, etc.)
2. Implement a proper GUI for configuration
3. Add support for Windows and Linux
4. Implement automated testing
5. Create platform-specific installers
